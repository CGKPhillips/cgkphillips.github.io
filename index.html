        &ldquo;We had a very special guest this week&mdash;Storyteller Cindy Phillips brought her incredible talent to
        our library and captivated our Kindergarten, 1st, and 2nd grade students with her unforgettable tales!
        The room was filled with wide eyes, giggles, and gasps as Cindy worked her storytelling magic. Just listen to
        what the kids had to say:
        <ul>
            <li>A 2nd grader exclaimed, &ldquo;She tells better stories than anyone!&rdquo;</li>
            <li>A curious 1st grader asked, &ldquo;How did you get so good at telling stories?&rdquo;</li>
            <li>And a kindergartner (with total seriousness) declared, &ldquo;This was the best story of my life!&rdquo;
            </li>
        </ul>
        We&apos;re pretty sure Cindy Phillips has officially earned &ldquo;Storytime Legend&rdquo; status around
        here.&rdquo;

        &ldquo;The entertaining stories captured our imaginations and kept us on the edge of our seats. Our kids enjoyed
        the audience participation aspects of each story and seemed to hang on every word.&rdquo;

    <blockquote>
        &ldquo;I was so excited to have Mrs. Phillips come to my classroom and tell my students her stories. Her amazing
        storytelling ability encouraged many of my students to grow their love for reading and creating their own
        stories. I could see this in their writing when they referenced something in one of her stories and also in
        their growing imaginations. All of my students truly loved when she would come and share her stories, as it
        would brighten up their day and give them something extra special to look forward to.&rdquo;

        &ldquo;Storytime with Ms. Cindy was a positive experience in our 3-and 4-year-old PreK rooms. We have students
        who have a hard time sitting and listening for more than a couple of minutes. The stories had each student
        captivated, waiting for what would come next.&rdquo;
