                        stories. Her amazing
                        storytelling ability encouraged many of my students to grow their love for reading and creating
                        their own
                        stories. I could see this in their writing when they referenced something in one of her stories
                        and also in
                        their growing imaginations. All of my students truly loved when she would come and share her
                        stories, as it
                        would brighten up their day and give them something extra special to look forward to.&rdquo;

                            <li>A 2nd grader exclaimed, &ldquo;She tells better stories than anyone!&rdquo;</li>

                            <li>And a kindergartner (with total seriousness) declared, &ldquo;This was the best story of
